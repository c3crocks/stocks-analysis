# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project
This project started was initiated to analyze the DAQO stocks for XXX' parents. 
However after the initial analysis we analyzed all the stocks since the DAQO stocks did not give promising results.
Hence stocks from the year 2017 and 2018 are being analyzed in the most optimal manner. 

### Results
After analyzing the data for 2017 we found that all stocks except for ticker "TERP" gave us promising results. 
Ticker 'DQ' followed by 'SEDG' and 'ENPH' occupied the top 3 results.
